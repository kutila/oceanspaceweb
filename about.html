        <p>OceanSpace is a Web-based application that supports user-customizable satellite data processing workflows. It contains an easy to use form-based Web interface which allows running pre-defined oceanographic satellite data processing workflows. Oceanographers can develop and add new types of data processing algorithms into OceanSpace and also configure new data processing workflows. OceanSpace uses the SeaDAS open source visualization, analysis and data processing package from the NASA Ocean Colour Biology Processing Group (OBPG) as its underlying data processing engine.
