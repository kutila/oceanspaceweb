        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Imagery from Earth Observing (EO) satellites are a major source of data for scientists who are monitoring sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs. At the University of Queensland, oceanographers are employing remote sensing satellite imagery to study the Great Barrier Reef, the largest living organism on Earth and a rich and diverse ecosystem that supports over 200 species of birds, 1500 species of fish, and 400 species of coral. The reef is adversely impacted by human activity as well as natural phenomena, and scientists are investigating how changes in water quality and sea surface temperature impact on its overall health.</p>
        <p>OceanSpace is a Web-based application that supports user-customizable satellite data processing workflows. It contains an easy to use form-based Web interface which allows running pre-defined oceanographic satellite data processing workflows. Oceanographers can develop and add new types of data processing algorithms into OceanSpace and also configure new data processing workflows. OceanSpace uses the SeaDAS open source visualization, analysis and data processing package from the NASA Ocean Colour Biology Processing Group (OBPG) as its underlying data processing engine.
