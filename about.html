        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living organism on Earth. It is a rich and diverse ecosystem that supports over 200 species of birds, 1500 species of fish, and 400 species of coral. The reef is adversely impacted by human activity as well as natural phenomena, and scientists are investigating how changes in water quality and sea surface temperature impact on its overall health.</p> 
        <p>Earth Observing (EO) satellites are a major source of data for scientists who are monitoring sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs. At the University of Queensland, the <a href="http://www.gpem.uq.edu.au/oceanography">Biophysical Oceanography Group</a> is employing remote sensing satellite data to study the Great Barrier Reef. They primarily use satellite radiances measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard NASA's <i>Aqua</i> and <i>Terra</i> satellites to generate images and analyses of important biophysical parameters such as water clarity and sea surface temperature, which can adversely impact the reefÂ¹s health.</p>
            <p>The aim of this collaborative project between the University of Queensland and Microsoft Research is to develop a web-based satellite image processing system and deploy it on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform to accelerate the processing of MODIS satellite imagery.</p>
