        <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The Great Barrier Reef is the largest living organism on Earth. It is a rich and diverse ecosystem that supports over 200 species of birds, 1500 species of fish, and 400 species of coral. The reef is adversely impacted by human activity as well as natural phenomena, and scientists are investigating how changes in water quality and sea surface temperature impact on its overall health.</p> 
        <p>Imagery from Earth Observing (EO) satellites are a major source of data for scientists who are monitoring sensitive marine ecosystems such as coral reefs. At the University of Queensland's <a href="http://www.gpem.uq.edu.au/oceanography">Biophysical Oceanography Group</a>, oceanographers are employing remote sensing satellite imagery to study the Great Barrier Reef. They primarily use satellite imagery from the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Radio Spectrometer) instrumentation on NASA's <i>Aqua</i> and <i>Terra</i> satellites to extract valuable data such as water quality and sea surface temperature of the Great Barrier Reef.</p>
            <p>The aim of this collaborative project between the University of Queensland and Microsoft Research is to develop a web-based satellite image processing system and deploy it on Microsoft's Azure cloud computing platform to accelerate the processing of MODIS satellite imagery.</p>
